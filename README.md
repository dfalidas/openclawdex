# OpenClawdex

Desktop UI for orchestrating Claude and Codex coding agents through their CLIs, with a native Mac feel.

> **Status:** Early alpha. The chat UI is functional with real Claude integration (via Agent SDK). Codex integration is planned.

## Install

Download the latest `.dmg` from the [Releases](https://github.com/alekseyrozh/openclawdex/releases) page.

### Prerequisites

OpenClawdex spawns CLI agents as subprocesses, so you need at least one installed and authenticated:

- **Claude Code** &mdash; `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` then `claude auth login`
- **Codex CLI** &mdash; install and run `codex login`

No API keys needed &mdash; the app uses your existing CLI logins.

### macOS note

The app is not code-signed yet. On first launch macOS may block it. To open it:
1. Right-click the app and choose **Open**
2. Or go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**

## Build from source

### Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 9+

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the Vite dev server + Electron
pnpm dev:desktop
```

The Electron window loads from `http://localhost:3000`. Hot reload works for the web app.

### Production build

```bash
# Build everything and package the macOS .dmg
pnpm dist
```

Output goes to `apps/desktop/release/`.

## Architecture

pnpm monorepo with three packages:

```
apps/
  web/       React + Vite + Tailwind v4 frontend
  desktop/   Electron shell + CLI agent integration
packages/
  shared/    Zod schemas for IPC messages
```

The Electron main process spawns `claude` (via Agent SDK with `--output-format stream-json`) and `codex` (via `app-server` JSON-RPC) as subprocesses, bridging their output to the React UI over IPC.
